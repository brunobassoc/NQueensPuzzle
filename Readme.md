# N-Queens Solver

This project consists of a Python implementation to solve the challenging N-Queens problem, a classic problem of placing pieces on an N-sized chessboard.

__*All explanations and instructions are in English*__

**Purpose**

The purpose of this repository is to provide a solution to the N-Queens problem, demonstrating programming skills and problem-solving abilities.

**Machine Specifications**

- CPU: Ryzen 5600 - 20%
- GPU: RTX 4060
- RAM: 32GB - 2GBs

**Contents**

This repository contains Python scripts that implement the solution to the N-Queens problem. The main included files are:

- `n_queens_solver.py`: Implementation of the solution to the N-Queens problem.
- `example.py`: An example of how to use the `n_queens_solver.py` implementation to solve the problem with a specific board size.

**Test Results**

| N   | Number of Queens | Number of Solutions | Time (Seconds) |
| --- | ---------------- | ------------------- | --------------- |
| 1   | 1                | 1                   | 0.0             |
| 2   | 2                | 0                   | 0.0             |
| 5   | 5                | 10                  | 0.000999        |
| 6   | 6                | 4                   | 0.0             |
| 7   | 15               | 2,279,184           | 1640.160 (27 min) |
| 8   | 16               | 14,772,512          | 12044.3958 (200.7 min) |

**Usage**

To use the N-Queens Solver, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
   
2. Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:\
git clone https://github.com/your-username/n-queens-solver.git

3. Navigate to the directory containing the Python scripts:\
cd n-queens-solver

4. Open the `n_queens_solver.py` file in your preferred code editor. This file contains the implementation of the N-Queens Solver algorithm.

5. Optionally, open the `example.py` file to see an example of how to use the N-Queens Solver implementation to solve the problem with a specific board size.

6. Execute the Python scripts in your Python environment. For example:\
python n_queens_solver.py

This will run the solver and display the solutions for the N-Queens problem.

7. You can also integrate the `n_queens_solver.py` script into larger projects as needed. The functions provided can be imported and used in other Python scripts.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your needs!
